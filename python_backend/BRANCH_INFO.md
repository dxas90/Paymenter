# Python Backend Branch Information

## Branch Creation Note

The Python backend implementation has been completed on the current branch: `copilot/fix-d49ccb9c-92f6-48be-afcc-b7ad9e681d3f`

A separate `python-backend` branch was also created locally but could not be pushed due to authentication restrictions. 

## To Create a Dedicated Python Backend Branch

If you want to create a dedicated branch for the Python backend, you can do so manually:

```bash
# From the repository root
git checkout -b python-backend copilot/fix-d49ccb9c-92f6-48be-afcc-b7ad9e681d3f

# Push the branch (if you have push access)
git push -u origin python-backend
```

Or, to create a PR from the current branch, the Python backend implementation is fully contained in the `python_backend/` directory and can be used as is.

## Implementation Location

All Python backend files are located in: `python_backend/`

The implementation includes:
- Complete FastAPI application
- Database models (SQLAlchemy)
- API endpoints (30+)
- Authentication system
- Documentation
- Docker support
- Test suite

## Branch Commits

The Python backend was implemented in these commits:
1. `85ef25e` - Add Python backend implementation with FastAPI
2. `02e7571` - Add comprehensive documentation, tests, and Docker support
3. `eeba8ca` - Add comprehensive implementation summary

## Using the Python Backend

The Python backend can be used immediately:

1. Navigate to `python_backend/` directory
2. Follow instructions in `QUICKSTART.md`
3. Or use Docker: `docker-compose up -d`

No separate branch is required - the implementation is complete and ready to use!
